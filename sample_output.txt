Inputs: Converse with the chatbot subject to your preference. However, the chatbot is made by an American company so you 
        should comunicate with it in English. 
       1.  You may input an English text or sentence, or a number from 1-9 but not an equation. But if your number is 0 or exceeded to 9 and is an equation, 
       your conversation with the chatbot would end. 

Sample Ouput 1: 
You: Hi!
Chatbot: Hello, user! 
You: Can you help me?
Chatbot: How may I help you? 
You: My english sucks can you help me with it?
Chatbot: Yes, I can help you with that! But your sentence, "My english *** can you help me with it?", contains an offensive word. 
In conversing with me, you must be polite. 
You: Sorry
Chatbot: It's okay!
You: Thank you! but it really sucks.
Chatbot: You're welcome! But your sentence, "Thank you! but it really ***.", contains an offensive word. In conversing with me, 
you must be polite. 
You: mY b4D
Chatbot: do you mean with "mY b4D" as "my bad"?
You: Yes. I want a racecar.
Chatbot: Okay! Wowww. Coool. Your sentence, "Yes. I want a racecar." contains a palindrome. So, if we reverse it, it's still the same, 
which is, racecar.
You: Okay, byei!
Chatbot: Okay, BYE?
You: whatevar
Chatbot: WHATEVER?
You: 9999990
